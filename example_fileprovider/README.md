# Traefik on Docker control access to an external server

Using Traefik with any of the numerous apps available in Docker containers is simple. But there may come a time when you need to redirect traffic for a non-docker app to an external server in the network.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Read the `README.md` on the root folder.
2. Configuration of DNS and SSL certificate like the example `basic`
3. A website outside the Docker environment.

### Installing

1. Add these lines to the Traefik definition in the `docker-compose.yml`. Where `/volume1/docker/traefik/FileProvider/` is a folder on your system that contains the dynamic configuration file for Traefik.

```yaml
command:
  - "--providers.file.directory=/FileProvider/"
volumes:
  - /volume1/docker/traefik/FileProvider/:/FileProvider/  #this line
```

2. In the directy `*/FileProvider/` create a file with file extension `.toml`, in this example is `file-provider.toml`.

```toml
[http]
  # Add the router
  [http.routers]
    [http.routers.plex]
      entryPoints = ["web-secure"]
      service = "service-plex"
      rule = "Host(`site.example.org`)"     #change domain name
      certresolver="certificato"
      [[http.routers.plex.tls.domains]]
        main = "*.example.org"              #change domain name

  # Add the service
    [http.services.service-plex]
      [http.services.service-plex.loadBalancer]
        [[http.services.service-plex.loadBalancer.servers]]
          url = "https://192.168.1.123:32400"
```

3. Change these points in the `.toml` file:

* routers name
* services name
* domain name (rule and certificate)
* url destination (please make attention if you use http or https)


4. Recreate the Traefik container and try in your browser if it works.

```bash
docker-compose up -d reverse-proxy
```

5. If you are not able to reach the site check if the DNS is correct. The answer should give the IP address of the Traefik container.

```bash
nslookup my.example.com
```

6. For security reasons is better to use HTTPS between the local server and the Traefik container.

If you find a problem in this guide or in the configurations files you can open an [issue](https://github.com/frigi83/traefik-examples/issues) on GitHub. Thanks!
